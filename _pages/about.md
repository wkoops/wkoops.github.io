I am a PhD student in the [Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)](https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/) group, headed by [prof. dr. Jakob Nordström](https://jakobnordstrom.se). The MIAO group is based on both sides of the Öresund Bridge at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), Sweden and the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/), Denmark. My research is funded by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/).

My current research interests include combinatorial optimization and proof logging for combinatorial optimization. In particular, goals include improving existing algorithms and designing new algorithms for pseudo-Boolean solving and pseudo-Boolean optimization, and developing proof logging for such algorithms. 

Before coming to Scandinavia, I was an ELLIS Excellence Fellow in the [Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods (AI-FM) group](https://ai-fm.org/) at Radboud University, Nijmegen. Here I was supervised by [dr. Sebastian Junges](https://sjunges.github.io/) and [prof. dr. Nils Jansen](https://www.nilsjansen.org/). Here I worked on (decentralized) partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and verification of stochastic dynamical systems.
